# chordal
Chord chart program for generating every possible fretting shape for a given chord, for guitars with any tuning and number of strings. Also does scales and arpeggios (arpeggios are WIP).
## Running
Execute frontend.py. Chordal uses only standard libraries, so it should run in your system's main Python environment.
